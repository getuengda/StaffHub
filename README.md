# StaffHub Back-end Spring Boot & MySQL

A Personal Website for Managing Staff, Training and Departments. This website was created for educational purposes and to showcase my back-end technical skills obtained during Per Scholas Full Stack Java Course, powered by TEKsystems. StaffHub is designed to provide staff and managers with a friendly interface to handle training (add, update, view trainings), view personal profiles, and departments. Managers (Admins) can create new staff, show/create/update all staffs, create/update training/department, and ensure efficient staff training management processes.

## Acknowledgments
- Imagine navigating a complex coding maze without a map or compass. That's what it would have been like without Pre Scholas powered by TEKSystem, and special thanks to my instructor Eric Heilig and my PD coach Krista. Their expert guidance and unwavering support charted the course for this project, leading me to the finish line.
