# StaffHub Back-end Spring Boot & MySQL

A Personal Website for Managing Staff, Training and Departments. This website was created for educational purposes and to showcase my back-end technical skills obtained during Per Scholas Full Stack Java Course, powered by TEKsystems. StaffHub is designed to provide staff and managers with a friendly interface to handle training (add, update, view trainings), view personal profiles, and departments. Managers (Admins) can create new staff, show/create/update all staffs, create/update training/department, and ensure efficient staff training management processes.
